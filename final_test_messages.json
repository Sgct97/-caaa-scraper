This could only be determined with a more complete study of any medical records that may shed more light on the left knee injury. To date no such records have been reviewed. Therefore it is my opinion that the present impairment to the left knee is related to a compensable consequence of the 12/08/17 specific injury and the 12/11/18 unreported injury. It is also within reasonable medical probability that the applicant will need a total left knee arthroplasty in the future.\"\nWe go to a depo to clarify but Dr. Owen flips flops at the depo giving defense what they want and then I clarify there was no other event or trauma that cause the left knee disability and he then agrees with me.\nI'm inclined to proceed with trial because there is no evidence to base a causation or apportionment of the left knee disability to create a substantial opinion. To me it is all conjecture and speculation.\nCan Judge Diamond parse through this? Is there any bias of not liking compensable consequence injuries I need to be aware of?\nTYIA for the feedback.",

Why do that?\nFor a serous post-surgical case, both PMR and MPA are my go-to\u2019s. They both will refer out to other specialties and provide pretty generous future medical treatment recommendations. For a pre-surgical, I would do a DCH if spine was a claimed body part. In my experience the DCH are actually the best at giving the \u201cmost accurate\u201d (i.e., highest) impairment per the AMA guides. However, a number of WCJ\u2019s are irrationally biased against DCH QME\u2019s and carriers will pretend that a DCH QME isn\u2019t as good as a QME from an MD.\nBret Graham, Esq.\nNava Graham Montebello\n420 N.
