He is giving a legal conclusion. His conclusions should be disregarded. The conclusions are clearly contrary to the AMA guides. On the other hand, I see no benefit to either you or the client by getting another doctor's opinion. I would use this argument to whatever extent you can get the DA to agree toward settlement.\nSecondly, to what extent is the DA aware of your applicants lies and overpayments? I'm assuming they don't know or that would have been part of your presentation. You cannot take this case to trial. You would be compounding or, at least condoning, a criminal act.\nI would recommend you getting the best settlement you can get and inform your client that you will either settle her case on that amount or you will recuse yourself from the case and file a lien for fees. (Whatever you can get her is more than she deserves.)\nIf the judge on the case won't let you out I would recommend going to the PJ and, without disclosing facts, indicate why you must recuse yourself. (Your Honor, there are reasons that I cannot disclose that justify my recusal.)\nIf that becomes a problem, check with the Bar Association for their insight.\nHopefully, this will free up more time for you and your legitimate clients.\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Hollie@TCLC.org\nSent: October 31, 2025 12:48:00 PM\nTo: lawnet@lists.trialsmith.com\nSubject: I didn't want to use Renbaum as AME, situation required it - now what?\nI didn't want to use Renbaum as AME, situation required it - now what?\nThis is on my client who lied to my VE, Def's VE and PQME stating she was unable to work and had not worked since retiring in 2021, when, in fact, she was working as a Respite Worker for her grandson who is autistic. A Respite Worker takes over when the primary caregiver can't take caregiving anymore. She thought she was being so clever to lie to everyone and get paid for taking care of her grandson. So, in lieu of falling on my sword, DA and I agreed to Renbaum as AME.\nI had written previously when Renbaum's report came out and he had apportioned all ortho body parts inured as 40% non-industrial without explaining \"how\" or \"why\", what should I do, challenge his apportionment? Get a better explanation? Or ignore it? Response was ignore it and get out of the liar's case ASAP. But I struck with it.\nSo. Renbaum had made a few other glaring \"situations\" in his report that needed fixing. A urologist PQME had assigned 5% WPI for incontinence caused by C-spine post-op pathology, original PQME and Urology PQME said to add the Uro PD percentage to the overall ortho percentage per Kite . So now there's Vigil . I asked Renbaum to comment on combining Uro PD percentage to ortho percetage. His response - get a new Urology QME.\nIW had an anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion C4-5, C5-6 on March 19, 2018. PQME found markedly abnormal (restricted) ROM at re-exam in May 2021 Renbaum found range of motion was \"full\" (he did state the degrees with the normals and they were all normal). I asked him if he used an inclinometer or a goniometer to measure the range of motion and could he please explain how IW rehabilitated her cervical spine range of motion from significantly reduced in May 2021 to full by February of 2025? Renbaum answered (this is verbatim), \" I do not think rating should be provided for range of motion, as in my opinion it is a very unreliable determinate of the level of impairment.\" Renbaum did not even answer my questions about inclinometer/goniometer and how IW rehabilitated her neck. He just said that irrespective of an employee's ROM, he would not consider ROM in his rating and he would never rate a spine using the ROM method.\nIn my view, Renbaum's response that he cannot rely on ROM to determine WPI and he doesn't believe in the ROM rating method is disqualifying. Should I challenge his qualifications? Get a better explanation of his opinion on ROM methodology? Or ignore it?\nIf the response is to ignore it and get out of the liar's case ASAP, any Judge who sees this case and reads Renbaum's reports will think I am a lousy, uneducated buffoon who doesn't know the first thing about WC.\nHollie Rutkowski, RN, JD, MBA, Esq.\n[ https://the-compensation-law-center.business.site/ ' The Compensation Law Center ]\nSacramento, CA 95834\nT:916.974.0424\nF:916.974.0428",
